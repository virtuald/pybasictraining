pybasictraining
===============

This is a repository that we'll use as a tool to teach you python. This is an
interactive learning experiment that gives you a number of challenges to
beat. To pass the challenges you will need to write python code.

Once you have passed these challenges, and understand the concepts required
for passing the challenges, you should have a reasonable grasp of how to do
a lot of basic things in python.

If you're having problems
=========================

1. Google for the solution (or bing, whatever)
2. Send an email to your peers, and see if they can help
3. Send an email to your team's mentor(s)

Most of the things that we're doing here is pretty simple, and google should
be able to point you to answers. Often, it will point you at [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com),
which is a really excellent resource for lots of programming questions.
